    <p>Ground-level ozone pollution, formed primarily from precursor gases emitted 
      by vehicle exhausts and industrial fumes, can damage vegetation. Negative 
      effects include visible injury on leaves, decreased growth and reductions 
      in quality and quantity of crop yield. As ozone pollution does not result 
      in any residue on the leaf surface, the most easily detectable evidence of 
      damage to vegetation is visible injury.
    </p>
    <p>The Ozone Injury App is an application that enables you to get involved in
      environmental monitoring. You can contribute your sightings with photos,
      GPS acquired coordinates, descriptions and other information, thus providing
      scientists with important new information that contributes to pollution control,
      conservation, planning, research and education.

    <p><strong>Who can use the app?</strong></p>
    <p>We welcome everyone to try using the app but particularly encourage people 
      who have experience of working regularly with plants, for example gardeners, 
      farmers, or surveyors. It doesn't matter whether you are an amateur enthusiast 
      or a qualified biologist, but it is useful if you are familiar with different 
      causes of leaf damage, including insect damage. The app is easy to use and it's 
      very quick to submit useful records. App users will be directly contributing 
      to the monitoring of ozone damage to vegetation.
